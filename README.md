#Scmd

Under development now.

#### Goals I'm trying to achieve:

* **Simplicity** - Client would be able to use it with little effort.
* **Versatility** - It has to be powerful enough to tackle those tricky things.
* **Beauty** - It should able to print attractive manual page.
* **Strictness** - As a library, it should be well structured, documented and self-encapsulated.
